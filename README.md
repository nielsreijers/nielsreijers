# Hi there, I'm Niels!

## Some repository highlights
As most of my work unfortuanately has been closed source (üòî) this is still a rather limited list.
- [CapeVM](https://github.com/nielsreijers/capevm) The sources for my PhD research, described in my [thesis](https://tdr.lib.ntu.edu.tw/handle/123456789/1247), and this [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3274783.3274842) (requires ACM digital library access). Not very polished code, so drop me a line if you're interested in reproducing the results.
- [categorytheory](https://github.com/nielsreijers/categorytheory) My answers so far to Bartosz Milewski's excellent [Category Theory for Programmers](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/). As you can see I'm stuck at Adjunctions. I should pick this up again sometime.
- [io_monad](https://github.com/nielsreijers/io_monad) A simple reimplementation of the IO Monad. Writing this really took away a lot of the mystery for me.

## Acronyms of choice:
- KISS
- DRY (when in conflict with KISS, prefer the first until n>2)
- YAGNI
